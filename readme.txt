WordPress Theme & Plugin management for the Envato Market.

== Description ==

The Envato Market plugin can install WordPress themes and plugins purchased from ThemeForest & CodeCanyon by connecting with the Envato Market API using a secure OAuth personal token. Once your themes & plugins are installed WordPress will periodically check for updates, so keeping your items up to date is as simple as a few clicks.

You can add a global token to connect all your items from your account, and/or connect directly with a specific item using a singe-use token & item ID. When the global token and single-use token are set for the same item, the single-use token will be used to communicate with the API.

== Installation ==

The latest version of the Envato Market plugin can be [**downloaded**](http://envato.github.io/wp-envato-market/dist/envato-market.zip) from the `gh-pages` branch as a WordPress installable package. **DO NOT** click the Github "Download ZIP" button, this plugin is meant to be installed in the WordPress `plugins` directory as `envato-market` and Github will not package the plugin correctly.

Installing the Envato Market plugin.

1. Download the `envato-market.zip` and unpack the archive.
1. Upload `envato-market` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
